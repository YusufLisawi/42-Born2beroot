# | what is A Virtual Machine (VM) |

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.One or more virtual “guest”
machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functionsseparately from the other VMs.

-> why VM ?

VMs can run multiple operating system environments on a single physical computer, saving physical space, time and management costs.
Trying out a new operating system (OS), including beta releases.
Backing up your existing OS.
Running software or apps on operating systems that they weren't originally intended for.

# | What is hypervisor |

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer,
to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

-> why hypervisor

Hypervisors make it possible to use more of a system’s available resources and provide greater IT mobility since the guest VMs are independent of the host hardware.
This means they can be easily moved between different servers. Because multiple virtual machines can run off of one physical server with a hypervisor,
- it’s just a fancy word for an application that we install on our OS, it creates a fake hardware by borrowing from our real hardware(CPU, RAM, storage..)

-> types of hypervisor

- type 1 is comonly used in data centers since it have direct access to the physical server hardware.
- type 2 is comonly used by students, or ppl who just want to try new OS, or do some experiments without harming their computer.

# |What is server|

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also...

# |What is Linux|

Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact,

Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources,like CPU, memory,
and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

# |What is Kernel Linux|

The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes.
It communicates between the 2,managing resources as efficiently as possible.

# |Process|

In computer science, a process is a program that is executing on a computer. When a program is launched, the operating system creates a process to run it. A process is an instance of a program that is running on a computer.

Each process has its own memory space and resources, such as CPU time and open files. The operating system is responsible for managing processes and allocating resources to them. Processes can run concurrently, meaning that multiple processes can be executing at the same time on a computer.

A process can be in one of several states, such as running, waiting, or terminated. When a process is running, it is being executed by the computer's CPU. When a process is waiting, it is not currently being executed, but it is ready to be run as soon as resources are available. When a process is terminated, it has completed execution or has been stopped by the operating system.

Processes can communicate with each other through various mechanisms, such as pipes or shared memory. They can also create new processes, called child processes, which can run concurrently with the parent process.

In general, the process of executing a program on a computer involves the following steps:

    The user launches the program.
    The operating system creates a process to run the program.
    The operating system allocates resources to the process, such as memory and CPU time.
    The process is executed by the CPU.
    When the process completes, it is terminated and the resources it was using are released.

|shorter|
In short, a process in a computer is an instance of a program that is executing on the computer. It has its own memory space and resources, and is managed by the operating system. Processes can run concurrently, meaning that multiple processes can be executing at the same time on a computer. A process can be in one of several states, such as running, waiting, or terminated. Processes can communicate with each other and create new processes, called child processes, which can run concurrently with the parent process.

The kernel has 4 jobs :

Memory management, Process management, Device drivers, System calls and security;

# |What is Debian|

Debian is a free operating system, developed and maintained by the Debian project. A free Linux distribution with thousands of applications to meet our users' needs.

-> why Dobian :

Debian is made of free and open source software and will always be 100% free. Free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
This is our main promise to our users. It's also free of cost.

Debian is a Linux-based operating system for a wide range of devices including laptops, desktops and servers. We provide a reasonable default configuration
for every package as well as regular security updates during the packages' lifetimes.

Most hardware is supported by the Linux kernel which means that Debian will support it as well.

It's easier to install and configure,

# |What different between software and operation system|

System software is the software that manages the resources and allows a user to interact with the system.

The operating system acts as the interface between the user and the computer hardware.

# |Centos Vs Debian|

-> similarities between Debian and CentOS

Both are free.
Both have community support.
Both are stable and get updated on a timely basis.
Debian, as well as CentOS, are both based on the Linux kernel.
 
-> Differences

CentOS is more stable and supported by a large community;
Debian has relatively less market preference;

For Package management, RPM as package format and YUM/DNF as the package manager are supported by CentOS;
whereas Debian has the DEB as package format and dpkg/APT as the package manager;

CentOS does not support many architectures;
Debian has more packages;

Dobian it has a graphical interface and user-friendly applications for the desktop;
CentOS It does not have an easy GUI;

Debian it easier to install and use;
CentOS it no easier in the install packages;

# |Files of the Debian|
 / :
- simple / represents the root directory. All other files and directories are contained in the root directory.

 /root :
- But don't get / confused with /root! /root is the home directory of the root user, or superuser. It's a directory called /root, but it isn't the root directory /.

 /bin :
- This directory contains "binaries," executable files which are essential to the operation of the system. Examples are: the shell (bash), and the commands you just learned such as cp.

 /sbin :
- This directory contains "system binaries," things that the root user or system administrator might want to use.

 /usr :
- contains most of the files you'll be interested in. It has many subdirectories: /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are pretty much like /bin and /sbin, except that the directories in /usr are not considered "essential to the operation of the system."
- While not essential to get the computer operating,/usr does contain the applications you'll use to get real work done. Also in /usr you'll find the /usr/man, /usr/info, and /usr/doc directories - these contain manual pages, info pages, and other documentation, respectively.

 /etc :
- contains all the system-wide configuration files. Whenever you want to change something that affects all users of your computer - such as how you connect to the internet, or what kind of video card you have - you'll probably have to log on as root and change a file in /etc.

- /tmp :
Here you'll find temporary files, most of them created by the system. This directory is generally erased on a regular basis, or every time you reboot the system. You can create files here if you want, just be aware they might get deleted automatically.

 /var :
- contains "variable" files, that the system changes automatically. For example, incoming mail is stored here. The system keeps a log of its actions here. There are a number of other automatically generated files here as well. You'll mostly be interested in the contents of /var/log,
- where you can find error messages and try to figure out what you're system's up to if something goes wrong.

/ srv :
- ontains site-specific data which is served by this system.

/ var/log :
- the records that Linux stores for administrators to keep track and monitor important events about the server, kernel, services, and applications running on it.

|-Partition-|

boot : The boot partition is the disk partition that contains the operating system folde also is a primary partition that contains the boot loader.
Swap : The primary function of swap space is to substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM fills up and more space is needed.

# |Wath is Apparmor|

AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control framework. When enabled, AppArmor confines programs according to a set of rules that specify what files a given program,
can access. This proactive approach helps protect the system against both known and unknown vulnerabilities.

also appArmor is an app that allow us restricte access of some apps, prgs.. allow access to only some parts of the system,
let only specific things to be done (raw socket access, and the permission to read, write, or execute files.


# |What is TCP|

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.
It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.


# |All About ssh|

-> What is ssh

ssh or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate.
it utilizes a client-server paradigm in which clients and servers communicate via a secure channel.

-|The SSH protocol has three layers| :

The transport layer :->

-- Ensures secure communication between the server and the client, monitors data encryption/decryption,
-- and protects the integrity of the connection. It also performs data caching and compression.

The authentication layer :->
-- Conducts the client authentication procedure.

The connection layer :->
-- Manages communication channels after the authentication.

some ssh terminology :

Client : A client program for establishing a connection with the server;
server : An SSH server program for communicating with SSH clients;
Connection layer : The layer of the SSH protocol that manages communication channels;
Private key : Part of the public-private key pair for user authentication kept as a secret on the local machine;
Public key  : Part of the public-private key pair for user authentication copied to the SSH server during the authentication process;

How ssh protocol does it works ?

The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server.
The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After the setup phase
the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data,
that is exchanged between the client and server.

-> another source :

SSH is a client-server based protocol. This means the protocol allows a device requesting information or services (the client)
to connect to another device (the server). When a client connects to a server over SSH, the machine can be controlled like a local computer.
The server has a designated TCP port over which it monitors the network, waiting for clients to initialize the connection. Before a client connects
and starts issuing SSH commands, it needs to pass the authentication process.


# |What is a port|

Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain protocols

# |What is a hostname|

A hostname is a label that is assigned to a the numeric address of a computer, server or network device. In the context of the Internet,
the hostname is typically the domain name and the numeric address of the computer or server is the IP address.

# |What is a IP|

An IP (Internet Protocol) address uniquely identifies a computer/server on the Internet.

# |All about Apt and Aptitude|

-> What is Apt and Aptitude

Aptitude and apt-get are two of the popular tools which handle package management.
Both are capable of handling all kinds of activities on packages including installation, removal, search etc.

-> About Apt :

APT stands for Advanced Packaging Tool. It is an open-source tool, which means you can use it without the need to pay anything.
APT is designed to handle software installation and removal. APT was part of Debian’s .deb package.

-> About Aptitude :

Aptitude is also an advanced packaging tool, This means that you can use Aptitude to install and remove packages using it, 

-> Differences between apt and Aptitude

apt It has many features reverse Aptitude for example apt --help apt -purg ...
when you what install a packages using the apt then apt if found a wrong Advantages, does nothing unlike Aptitude if found any wrong Advantages
he update them and install the package without any problem

another different :<

when you what to upgrade system by (apt upgrade), then apt Updates packages except for packages related to a system Example if you are on verion 12
you will not convert to version 13 Unless you use apt dist-upgrade.
then Aptitude upgrade all without any problem

# |What is tty|

Linux operating system represents everything in a file system, the hardware devices that we attach are also represented as a file.
The terminal is also represented as a file. There a command exists called tty which displays information related to terminal.

# |What is cron and crontab|

Cron :->
comes from chron, the Greek prefix for ‘time’. Cron is a daemon which runs at the times of system boot.

Crontab :->
(CRON TABle) is a file which contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and at specified times. File location varies by operating systems.

# |What is ufw|

is a firewall, it stands for uncomplicated firewall, a firewall is a network security system that prevents unauthorized access from entering a private network
by filtering the incoming network data, based on its rules (access control list, contains IP, protocol, destination and port)

# |lighttpd|

Lighttpd is a “secure, fast, compatible and very flexible” web server optimized for high-performance environments. It consumes very few resources compared to other web servers and especially fast for running AJAX applications. It is also open source and uses a BSD license and works on UNIX-like systems, such as Linux or BSD.

Combining Debian with Lighttpd is a safe bet if you want a fast, efficient and secure web server. Go for it.
